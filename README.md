# IROR - DBMS MINI PROJECT

# Problem Statement

The railway network of our country is one of the most complex public establishments. You can design a database solution for this network and make the management of the same more natural. Your system should have the following pieces of information:
The objective of the online railway ticket reservation system

That is:

1. To create a database of the trains
2. To search the trains it’s arrival and departure times, and distance between the source and
destination.
3. To check the availability of the ticket.
4. To calculate the fare.
5. To book the ticket.
6. To cancel the ticket if necessary. Online railway ticket reservation is an online ticket booking website, which is capable of booking tickets and searching the train availability.

This website is mainly created to fulfill the following requirements, it comprises the following properties:

- A central database that will store all information.
- An online website that will provide real-time information about the availability of tickets and their prices.
- Every registered user is able to view his booking id that has been made in his/her name.
- Every registered user can change his password any time he wants to change it.
- Every guest user can search train availability, price of the ticket, arrival and departure time, distance between source and destination, etc.
- Every registered user has the facility to print his ticket any time he wishes.
- Administration login. In admin mode, the administrator can make changes in train details. He can also view all booking that has been made by different users.
- The booking window contains all the facilities in one place, the user can simply log in to his account and can book his ticket.

# **Objectives**

- The railway reservation system's main goal is to offer the railway network a structural framework.
- Only the administrator is granted access because the project is fully established on the administrative end.
- The project gives the railway system functionality and flexibility so that anybody can use it quickly and effectively.
- Additionally, this project offers a comprehensive array of solutions for several typical and specialized railroad work-related problems.

# **Purpose of IROR**

The Ministry of Railways of the Government of India owns Indian Railways, a legal organization. It controls India's 7,325 stations and 67,956 km (42,226 mi) of total route length, making it the fourth biggest national railway system in the world by size. It has millions of passengers in it and runs 13,169 passenger trains every day, so managing it manually would be a difficult task. By computerizing it, we will be able to overcome many of its limitations and make it more efficient. If the system is automated, handling the data and records for such a big system can be considerably simpler than it would be if it were done manually.

# Features of IROR

- IROR offers up-to-the-minute details on ticket costs and availability.
- Every registered user gets access to their tickets and the option to print them whenever they want.
- Each visitor can do a search for the availability of trains, ticket costs, arrival and departure times, distances between sources and destinations, train routes and other information.
- IROR also offers services such as listings of available trains, verifying the status of PNRs, seat availability, and more.
- In admin mode, the administrator can make changes to train details. The administrator may also see every booking that has been made by various users.
- Passengers can simply cancel their tickets without paying any fees if they choose to do so.
- IROR also offers its users data security.
